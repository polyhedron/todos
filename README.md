# About the todos app!

  - index.html is the base page
  - index.html uses the react javascript library, bootstrap css library, babel for transcompiling, and axios for ajax calls
  - ajax/todos.php is where the JSON data comes from. This is a PHP file that encodes array or database information into JSON.
  - sql/todos.sql is the sql file that will generate and pre-populate data into the database.
